I think this is due to other people attempting the same thing as you at the same time. You cannot leave the navigation menu or it cancels the que. 
            Using way #2 it is best to organize the squad via a discord thread and ensure correct roles and loadouts ahead of time before inviting anyone, including who is running enemy radar (1or2). Once everyone is ready to begin, invite one of them only, once they join the 20 second countdown will begin, you need to wait till the mission starts to send the invite to the other 2 players to avoid it canceling the mission.

            Doing this lets you get more out of a good defense tileset without having to risk going past 100w with defense operative. This can be good just in case the next arbi ends up not being a good tileset. For an Interception; this is not necessary due to the much slower enemy level scaling.

            1- Form a group and then go to relay for blessing.
            2- All 4 players leave the relay, after that group back up.
            3- Go back into relay, start arbi mission from the relay
            4- After 60-70w Extract 5-10 minutes before the hour changes the arbi.
            5- While inside relay and you will be able to do the arbi again for full 100w

            **If you exit the relay after doing it the first time it will remove the arbi from navigation.**

            This works out well for most defense tilesets, except for the Ice planet tileset which has 3 possible spawns, it's not worth trying to double dip unless all 4 players are trackin to keep pm's open for the 3 other members to be able to easily invite them as all 4 players attempt to find the good ice planet tile, then once someone finds it they send invites to the other 3. Don‚Äôt forget to set the party to ‚ÄúFriends only‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvite Only‚Äù to avoid randoms. Most prefer not to bother double dipping for Ice planet tile due to not getting the right tile the 2nd time around or if one of the players that gets it could potentially prove to have poor connection as a host.

            Steps 1-3 can be employed as a failsafe for all missions. In the event someone DCs early on or if someone has to leave, you‚Äôll be able to do the arbi again.

            *Try to suppress the urge to press TAB to view kills and damage% during arbitrations, especially later on in the mission. Game client becomes clunky during longer missions and people will disconnect from host. I just wouldn‚Äôt press tab at all for defense, and for interception you can kinda get away with it during wave changes where you're capturing points. Another bug, If you are playing windowed or have multi monitor setup and your game pauses when you ALT TAB, then you will disconnect from the host if you do so for more than 7 seconds.
